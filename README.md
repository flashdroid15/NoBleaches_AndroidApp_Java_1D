## Background

### Problem

There are 3 housing blocks for the students of SUTD, where each block has a dedicated laundry room for clothes to be washed and dried. Students regularly face inconveniences when they enter the laundry room. Either the machines are in use, or the clothes have not been emptied out, or the machine requires servicing. Thus, the inconclusiveness about the normal functioning of the machines makes planning difficult.

Having experienced these troubles ourselves, our problem statement for our project was framed as follows: “How might we make the laundry system at the SUTD Hostel blocks more convenient for hostel residents?”

### Solution

Given the reliance SUTD students have on their mobile devices, building an application for users would be favourable since they can be notified right when their clothes are available to pick up, they can find out what machines are free and make reservations 15 minutes ahead to save time. An application that allows most of the work to be done remotely rather than having to physically enter the vicinity would greatly save time.  

The application, named NoBleaches, was built for mobile devices using Android as their Operating System. Android Studio was used to build and develop the app, using Java for giving the app functionality and XML for enabling user-computer interaction. 

NoBleaches was built to assist with sustainability issues in mind. A reservation history feature was baked in to identify the demand for washers and dryers, recognize which machines required frequent servicing and what machines were avoided. Having the luxury of checking machine status from afar wastes less resources on the user’s part, which helps reduce crowding and congestion in each hostel block’s laundry room. 

Moreover, NoBleaches’ User Interface (UI) is simple and has a very low learning curve to use the application’s features. This makes the application accessible to even those with minimal technological experience.
